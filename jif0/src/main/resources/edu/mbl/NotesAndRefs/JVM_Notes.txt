JVM Args, etc...

=======================================
Passing in properties to the JVM
-D<property>=<value>

----------------------
Look & Feel
-Dswing.defaultlaf=
Start your VM with 
  -Dswing.defaultlaf=org.jvnet.substance.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel
in source: 
  UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel())
  UIManager.setLookAndFeel("org.jvnet.substance.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel")
----------------------
GUI / 2D-related

-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false 
-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true 
-Dsun.java2d.ddoffscreen=false
-Dswing.bufferPerWindow=false 

-Dawt.nativeDoubleBuffering=true (shows all repaints)

System.setProperty("sun.awt.noerasebackground", "true");

Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().setDynamicLayout(true);
Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported");

-Dswing.aatext=true Font anti-aliasing 

------------------------
-Xverify:none (this switch turns off Java bytecode verification, making classloading faster)
----------------------
OpenGL
java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true 
  or
System.setProperty("sun.java2d.opengl", "true");
----------------------
-Djava.security.policy=applet.policy
-----------------------
JNI:
-Djava.library.path=/...
---------------------
Debugging
-verbose:[jni | class | gc]
-Xcheck:jni
-Xlint:path - Shows classpath errors that wouldn't otherwise appear
----------------------
Crash Error Log File:
-XX:ErrorFile=/var/log/java/java_error%p.log
(Defaults to dir in TMP or TEMP env. variable)
String variable = System.getenv("WINDIR");
------------------------
Enviroment Variables:
Java > 1.5
Map<String, String> variables = System.getenv();
for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : variables.entrySet()) {
   String name = entry.getKey();
   String value = entry.getValue();
   System.out.println(name + "=" + value);
}
----------------------
Garbage collection

-Xincgc

-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC or -J-XX:+UseParNewGC - try these switches if you are having problems with intrusive garbage collection pauses. 
This switch causes the JVM to use different algorithms for major garbage collection events (also for minor collections, if run on a 
multiprocessor workstation), ones which do not "stop the world" for the entire garbage collection process. 
You should also add the line -J-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled and -J-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled to your netbeans.conf 
file so that class unloading is enabled (it isn't by default when using this collector).

-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy - this switch may help improve garbage collector throughput and memory footprint. 
It is part of garbage collector ergonomics implemented in JDK5.0.

-XX:+UseParallelGC - some tests have shown that, at least on systems fairly well equipped with memory, 
the durations of minor garbage collections is halved when using this collection algorithm, on uniprocessor systems. 
Note that this is paradoxical - this collector is designed to work best on multiprocessor systems with gigabyte heaps. 
No data is available on its effect on major garbage collections. Note: this collector is mutually exclusive with -J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC. . 
The measurements supporting the use of this algorithm can be found on the performance website.

-XX:+PrintGCDetails - this is similar switches (like -J-verbose:gc) do not improve performance but provide diagnostic data 
showing information about memory management that are useful source of input for performance tuning. Another way how to 
obtain these data is to use monitoring tools or (NetBeans) profiler.

-XX:CompileThreshold=100 - this switch will make startup time slower, by HotSpot to compile many more methods down 
to native code sooner than it otherwise would. The reported result is snappier performance once the IDE is running, 
since more of the UI code will be compiled rather than interpreted. This value represents the number of times a 
method must be called before it will be compiled.

-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true - this switch will suppress use of IPv6 stack in networking code and it can avoid
small delay during startup when inet address is being resolved. It will be usefull only on a system where IPv6 is 
installed but not actually configured.
